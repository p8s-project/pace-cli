# Getting Started with `Vezia`

Welcome to `Vezia`! This guide will walk you through installing the `vez` CLI and generating your first piece of cloud infrastructure in under 5 minutes.

`Vezia` is a tool for generating production-ready infrastructure code from a simple, human-friendly manifest. Think of it as "Homebrew for the Cloud."

## Prerequisites

*   You have the Go toolchain installed on your machine.
*   You have Git installed.

## Step 1: Install the `vez` CLI

The easiest way to install `vez` is by downloading the latest pre-compiled binary for your operating system from our [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/Vezia/vez-cli/releases).

1.  Download the appropriate binary for your system (e.g., `vez-darwin-amd64`).
2.  Make it executable.
3.  Move it to a directory in your `PATH`.

```bash
# Example for macOS
chmod +x ./vez-darwin-amd64
sudo mv ./vez-darwin-amd64 /usr/local/bin/vez

# Verify the installation
vez version
```

Alternatively, you can install via `go install`:
```bash
go install github.com/Vezia/vez-cli@latest
```

## Step 2: Define Your Infrastructure

The `app.yaml` is where you, as a developer, declare *what* infrastructure you need. Create a new file named `app.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
# app.yaml
name: my-first-vezia-app
resources:
  - id: my-awesome-bucket
    uses: s3-bucket:v1
    with:
      versioning: true
```

This simple manifest requests a new S3 bucket by referencing a resource type (`s3-bucket:v1`) from the catalog.

## Step 3: Generate Your Code

Now, run the `vez generate` command.

By default, `vez` is configured to use a public "starter kit" catalog that provides common, high-quality open-source modules. You don't need any extra configuration to get started.

```bash
# Run the generate command
vez generate --app-file app.yaml --output-dir ./infra
```

This command creates a new directory named `infra/` containing a file named `my-awesome-bucket.tf`.

## Step 4: See the Results

Inspect the generated file:

```bash
cat ./infra/my-awesome-bucket.tf
```

You will see a complete, production-ready Terraform module block for an S3 bucket, generated from your simple, three-line request.

```hcl
# This file was generated by Vezia.

module "my-awesome-bucket" {
  source  = "terraform-aws-modules/s3-bucket/aws"
  version = "3.15.1"

  bucket               = "my-awesome-bucket"
  versioning = {
    enabled = true
  }
}
```

## Next Steps

Congratulations! You've just seen the core workflow of `Vezia`.

From here, you can:
*   `cd` into the `infra` directory and run `terraform init` and `terraform apply`.
*   Run `vez validate` to check your manifest against the catalog.
*   Learn how to create a private catalog for your organization by reading our **[Private Catalog Guide](PRIVATE_CATALOG_GUIDE.md)**.
*   Explore adding more resources to your `app.yaml`, like a `postgres-db` or a `redis-cache`.
